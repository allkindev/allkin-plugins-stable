# File explorer

Browse and manage the files of the agents from Allkin.

## “Files” tab of an agent

The folder button on the row of an agent opens its `data/` space:

- navigation by folders (a “Parent folder” row to go up); sort by name, size or date (column
  headers; on a phone, a “Sort” button);
- **everything is done from the header of the page**, with icon buttons: search (the name filter
  only takes a row when you open it), upload files, new folder, new file, selection — Allkin's ⋮
  menu has nothing to offer here;
- **one icon per type**: folder, image, PDF, archive, script, code, data, text… the bin and the
  `Upload` folder have their own;
- a newly created file opens right away;
- **upload** of files and of whole folders by drag and drop, with progress — or through the
  system picker (“Upload” button of the header), the only way on a phone;
- **context menu** (right click, long press, or the ⋯ button of each row): open, download,
  select, copy, cut, paste, rename, archive, extract, new file, new folder, upload, delete;
- **multiple selection**: “Selection” button of the header, or “Select” on an item. A bar then
  appears with All / Download / Move / Delete / Done — at the bottom of the screen on a phone;
- **bin**: “Empty the bin” in the context menu, when you are inside it;
- every confirmation and input goes through Allkin's windows, and every action answers with a
  bubble;
- zip/tar **archives**, and download of a folder as a zip;
- **running `.sh` scripts**, after reading their content, with the output live;
- **bin**: what is deleted goes to `Trash/`, which can be emptied separately.

With the *Image editor* plugin, the context menu of an image offers **Edit the image**.

A click on a file opens it in the *Text editor* plugin if it is installed, and downloads it
otherwise.

## Shared folder

In the Plugins list of the Allkin menu, **Shared folder** opens `~/.allkin/share`, common to every
agent and every plugin: all of them read, write, add and delete there. Same page as an agent's
files, without running scripts. A folder named after an installed plugin is that plugin's: its
content can change, the folder itself stays. Copying or cutting in an agent's files and pasting
in the shared folder (or the other way round) goes from one to the other.

## Explorer of `~/.allkin`

From the home page, a **read-only** walk through Allkin's installation folder: agents, sessions,
backups. Secrets cannot be read there. A file opens in a **viewer** tab, on a blue ground: raw
text without colouring or layout, an image, a PDF, or the entries of an archive (zip, tar) without
extracting it; other kinds are downloaded.

## Without this plugin

No more Files tab nor explorer: the folder button of the agents and the “Explorer” button of the
home page disappear. The agents themselves keep access to their files according to their rights.

## Permission requested

- **Allkin interface** — the plugin runs in Allkin's page, with your session.
